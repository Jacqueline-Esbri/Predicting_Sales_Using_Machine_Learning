# Wireless Infrastructure Analysis
## Overview of Wireless Infrastructure Analysis
### Background

Our client works in the telecom industry for a wireless carrier company and is looking to expand to other cities. The client has asked our team of professional data analysts to predict the number of towers the company will need to expand their services in a certain city.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze Kaggle dataset and predict he number of towrs the wireless carrier company will need.

### Resources

The technologies used for this project includes:
- Technologies
- languages 
- tools 
- algorithms

### Communication Protocol

To prepare for this project, the team of analysts refered to as teh "Red Team" created a communication protocol that includes the following:

- Post team meeting schedule and invitation information on Slack. 
- Inform the acting leader via Slack, text message, or other social media outlets when absent from a scheduled meeting.
- Ask for help when stuck on an individual task.
- Inform the acting leader if the task will be completed late.
- Inform the acting leader if an emergency situation presents itself and the team needs to complete the task.
- Praise a team member for a work well done.
- Team leader will update team members of any changes due to emergencies or a team member needing help with a task.

### Reason for topic selection

This topic is also relevant and practical with the push for 5G, and potential stakeholders (e.g., employers) could relate to it and/or benefit from it. It could also impress any company that is interested in communications systems.

### Data Description

THe data selected had over 1,200 rows, it was downloaded for use. Another dataset was also chosen as a backup, which had over 700 rows. We are contemplating on using both datasets, and therefore have well over the required number of data points. The dataset is titled SF\_wireless\_facility\_kaggle\_data. 

The dataset was inspected to ensure we had at least 1,000 data points. After it was confirmed that the dataset.
