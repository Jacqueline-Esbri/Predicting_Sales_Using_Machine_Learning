# Wireless Infrastructure Analysis

## Overview of Wireless Infrastructure Analysis

### Background

Our client is a startup company that plans to provide cell tower maintenance and installation services for wireless carriers. They believe the introduction of 5G, along with required upgrades and maintenance on current generation wireless systems, provides a huge market for their services. The startup plans to launch in San Francisco (SF), CA. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to investigate existing cell tower sites in SF to determine the capital needed for a successful launch, based on the size of the market.

### Resources

The technologies used for this project includes:

- SQLite
- Python & Pandas library
- Postgres, MongoDB 
- Algorithm â€“ Scikit-Learn

### Communication Protocol

To prepare for this project, the team of analysts referred to as the "Red Team" created a communication protocol that includes the following:

- Post team meeting schedule and invitation information on Slack. 
- Inform the acting leader via Slack, text message, or other social media outlets when absent from a scheduled meeting.
- Ask for help when stuck on an individual task.
- Inform the acting leader if the task will be completed late.
- Inform the acting leader if an emergency situation presents itself and the team needs to complete the task.
- Praise a team member for a work well done.
- Team leader will update team members of any changes due to emergencies or a team member needing help with a task.

### Reason for topic selection

This topic is relevant and practical with the push for 5G, and potential stakeholders (e.g., employers) could relate to it and/or benefit from it. It could also impress any company that is interested in communications systems.

### Data Description

The data selected had over 1,200 rows. It was downloaded from Kaggle for use. Another dataset was also chosen as a backup, which had over 700 rows. The dataset is titled SF\_wireless\_facility\_kaggle\_data. 

The dataset was inspected to ensure we had at least 1,000 data points. After inspection, the next step will include deciding if we want to drop or replace null rows ( for example).

### Project Questions

The question for our project are the following:

- What will be the initial investment for the startup?
- Will the radio frequency range support 5G?
- Does the aggregate power support the addition of frequency band?
- What is the height to the top of the cell tower?
