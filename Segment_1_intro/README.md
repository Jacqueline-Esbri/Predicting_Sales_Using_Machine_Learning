For the final project, we selected a topic on wireless infrastructure. One of our team members, Josh Shehan, works in the telecom industry. He currently designs antenna systems for a variety of applications. So, Josh suggested we work on something related to commercial wireless telecommunications services. We all agreed, since we found the topic to be interesting for our project.

Josh also informed us that there was a Kaggle dataset for telecom facilities in San Francisco (SF), and suggested use of the data and approach it from a wireless carrier perspective. For instance, say T-Mobile wanted to expand to a city where they currently have a limited number of cell towers. In this case, we can use the SF telecom facility data along with demographic data for SF to predict the numbers of towers T-Mobile might need in a place like Austin, TX.

This topic is also relevant and practical with the push for 5G, and potential stakeholders (e.g., employers) could relate to it and/or benefit from it. It could also impress any company that is interested in communications systems.

The dataset was inspected to ensure we had at least 1,000 data points. After it was confirmed that the dataset had over 1,200 rows, it was downloaded for use. Another dataset was also chosen as a backup, which had over 700 rows. We are contemplating on using both datasets, and therefore have well over the required number of data points. The dataset is titled SF\_wireless\_facility\_kaggle\_data.

Next, Sindie created our repo on GitHub. The repo name was then discussed among the team members and everyone agreed to name the repo Wireless\_Infrastructure\_Analysis. Invitiations were sent by Sindie to collaborate on the repo on GitHub. Now, we are working on creating our branches to the repo so we can begin the collaborating process.
