# Predicting Sales Using Machine Learning

 
## Overview

Our goal is to predict sales of video games using Machine Learning (ML) based on sales outside of North America, genre, and video game platforms.


## Purpose

The gaming industry is immensely large and it is continuing to grow. As such, many companies want to be part of the growing revenue stream. Our task entails building a predictive ML model to find patterns in new and unseen sales data. We believe that using ML will allow us to leverage existing algorithms to learn from from the data and lead more accurate predictions.

To accomplish this task, we will build and evaluate several ML models or algorithms. Once we implement the algorithms, we will evaluate the performance to see how well the models predict the data. Our main goal is to market our algorithm to existing companies in the gaming sector or organizations looking to get involved in the industry.


## Resources

The technologies planned to be used for this project include the following:

- Python & Pandas library
- PostgreSQL & pgAdmin
- mlenv (Numpy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn)
- Imbalanced-learn Package
- Tableau
- JavaScript


## Communication Protocol

To prepare for this project, a team of analysts referred to as the "Red Team" created the following communication protocol: 

- Discuss role distribution
- Use Slack channel to schedule meetings, discuss opinions and findings 
- Inform the acting leader via Slack or text message on schedule conflicts
- Ask for help when stuck on an individual task
- Inform the acting leader if the task will be completed late
- Inform the acting leader when emergency task reassignment will need to take place
- Praise a team member for a work well done
- Team leader will update team members of any changes due to emergencies or a team member needing help with a task
- Maintain open communication and active listening to prevent conflicts 


## Reason for topic selection

Predicting video game sales was considered to be an interesting and fun topic to analyze. Video games have been around for many years and have evolved significantly over time. Game development is also becoming increasingly common in many organizations. It is also a huge market that provides entertainment for children and adults alike. 


## Data Description

The CSV dataset has 16,599 rows and 11 columns. The dataset contains the following columns:
- Rank
- Name
- Platform
- Year
- Genre
- Publisher
- Sales (NA, EU, JP, Other, Global)

## Project Question

This project attempts to answer how profitable are the sales of North America based on sales from other countries, genre, and platform.
